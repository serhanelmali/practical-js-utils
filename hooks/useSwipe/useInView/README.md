# useInView Hook

`useInView` is a React hook leveraging the Intersection Observer API to easily track the visibility of DOM elements as they enter or leave the viewport. This hook is ideal for triggering animations, loading content lazily, or any other action that depends on the element's visibility.

## Installation

To use `useInView` in your project, copy the `useInView.tsx` file into your hooks directory. Ensure your project is set up to support TypeScript if you are using the TypeScript version.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `useInView` hook in a component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import useInView from "./hooks/useInView"; // Adjust the import path as necessary

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isVisible, ref] = useInView({
    threshold: 0.1, // Trigger when 10% of the target is visible
  });

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      {isVisible ? (
        <p>The component is visible.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Scroll down to see me!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

##API
useInView accepts an options object with the following optional properties:

- `root`: The element that is used as the viewport for checking the visibility of the target. Defaults to the browser viewport if not specified.
- `rootMargin`: Margin around the root specified in a way similar to the CSS margin property. Useful for expanding or contracting the viewport area for visibility checks.
- `threshold`: A single number or an array of numbers indicating at what percentage of the target's visibility the observer's callback should be executed. This allows for more granular visibility checks.
